# Install
Simply copy all repo in your htdocs. I've used sqlite, then all the app, included user, roles and permission management should work without any other action.

If you want you can change db driver by porting the schema to another driver. You found the current schema directly in adminer or in the main view of the app.

# Improvements
- CI base classes
- CI base model
- Alerts
- Bootstrap
- User and roles
- Uri based permissions
- ability to recover and change password
- remember login via cookie
- file manager with model and db
